# adjTomo Docker Container
For the SPECFEM Users Workshop (Oct. 5-7, 2022)

This is a reference file that lists the Git hashes for all the packages that are installed in the 
adjTomo Docker Container. Although the static image itself should be the direct record of which
versions are installed, I think it's useful to have a separate record of exactly which software 
was used so that we can **always** re-run the workshop material in the future, despite upgrades or 
changes in the underlying software.

>__Note:__ adjDocs was being constantly updated throughout the workshop. The commit shown here 
    represents the latest version which contains all updates and any bug fixes that happenend 
    after the workshop was finished.
