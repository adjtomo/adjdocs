    "# SPECFEM Users Workshop -- Day 1 (Oct. 5, 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forward Simulations in SPECFEM2D and 3D\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant to walk Users through an introduction to `SPECFEM2D`, from a) navigating a SPECFEM2D working directory, to b) generating a mesh, to c) running forward simulations. We make note of important files and steps to take when running forward simulations in SPECFEM. Background material is included to understand the task at hand, and we also draw parallels with `SPECFEM3D`, illustrating how to mesh and run simulations on a simple 3D domain. At the end of the workshop, we will take a look at how we can use `SeisFlows` to automate SPECFEM2D for running forward simulations.\n",
