    "SeisFlows is an automated workflow tool which takes care of all the tasks required to run SPECFEM. In essence, SeisFlows is a Python wrapper for SPECFEM, which includes modular components for interfacing with various compute systems. It also employs various preprocessing and optimization methods for seismic inversions (to be completed in Day 2, 3). We can automate forward simulations for multiple events in the Example we just ran. SeisFlows Example 3 runs a automated en-masse forward simulations."
