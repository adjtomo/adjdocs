    "TO DO:\n",
    "- Run a manual model update by guessing the perturbation as the negative gradient? Try to follow golden rule or smoething\n",
    "- Attempt one or two updates manually, checking waveform misfit each time\n",
    "- Then run Example 1 to show HH models\n",
    "- Run Example 2 for inversion\n",
    "- Allow users to play around with starting model, preprocessing etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this notebook we will bring all of the previous material together run a full seismic inversion to update a starting model. \n",
