    "## Part 1A: Intro to SPECFEM2D\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant to walk Users through an introduction to `SPECFEM2D`, from a) navigating a SPECFEM2D working directory, to b) generating a mesh, to c) running forward simulations. We make note of important files and steps to take when running forward simulations in SPECFEM. Background material is included to understand the task at hand. Understanding `SPECFEM2D` will help us draw parallels with `SPECFEM3D` in future notebooks. We will also use the information learned here to get a better understanding of how software like `SeisFlows` automate SPECFEM2D.\n",
