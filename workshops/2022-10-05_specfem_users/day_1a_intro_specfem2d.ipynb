    "\n",
    "- Day 1A notebook is meant to walk Users through an introduction to `SPECFEM2D`, which includes:\n",
    "    - navigating a SPECFEM2D working directory\n",
    "    - generating a 2D mesh with homogeneous halfspace model\n",
    "    - running forward simulations to generate synthetic seismograms. \n",
    "- We will note important files and key steps to take when running SPECFEM. \n",
    "- **Objective**: Understanding `SPECFEM2D` to help draw parallels with `SPECFEM3D` and better understand of how software like `SeisFlows` automates SPECFEM\n",
    "- These instructions should be run from inside the Docker container, using Jupyter Lab (see *Docker Preamble*). \n",
