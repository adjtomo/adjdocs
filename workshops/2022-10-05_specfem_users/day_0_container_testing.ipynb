    "- Day 0 instructions are meant for Users to test out their Docker container to ensure that things will go smoothly during the workshop.  \n",
    "- Estimated times are provided next to each task to provide a benchmark on how fast thing should run. Benchmarks were run on a 2015 Macbook Pro (OSX 10.14.6) with 3.1GHz Intel Core i7, and 16Gb of ram. \n",
    "- If you run into any issues while running through this notebook, please copy the error message and make note of which cell created the error.\n",
    "- These instructions should be run from inside the Docker container, using Jupyter Lab. The Docker container should have the adjTomo toolkit installed (SeisFlows, Pyatoa, PySEP), as well as SPECFEM2D and SPECEFM3D compiled with MPI. \n",

    "- **Run all cells** by hitting the $\\blacktriangleright\\blacktriangleright$ button at the top, or by running `Run -> Run All Cells`\n",
    "- **Currently running cells** that are still processing will have a `[*]` symbol next to them\n",
    "- **Finished cells** will have a `[1]` symbol next to them. The number inside the brackets represents what order this cell has been run in.\n",
    "- Commands that start with `!` are Bash commands (i.e., commands you would run from the terminal)\n",
    "- Commands that start with `%` are Jupyter Magic commands.\n",

    ">__Docker command explanation__:\n",
    "The `pull` command downloads the Docker Image from GitHub. The Docker `run` command launches the Docker container. The `--mount` flag binds our local filesystem (in the current working directory, pwd) with the container's internal filesytem (at location /home/scoped/work). The `--shm-size` flag  tells Docker to give us 512 Megabytes of shared memory, which is required for MPI processes.\n",
