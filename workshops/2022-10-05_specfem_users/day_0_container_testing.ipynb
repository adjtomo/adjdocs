    "# SPECFEM Users Workshop (Oct. 5-7, 2022)\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 0: Container Testing Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Day 0 instructions are meant for Users to test out their Docker container to ensure that things will go smoothly during the workshop.  \n",
    "- Estimated times are provided next to each task to provide a benchmark on how fast thing should run. \n",
    "- Benchmarks were run on a 2015 Macbook Pro (OSX 10.14.6) with 3.1GHz Intel Core i7, and 16Gb of ram. \n",
    "- If you run into any issues while running through this notebook, please copy the error message and make note of which cell created the error.\n",
    "- These instructions should be run from inside the Docker container, using Jupyter Lab (see *Docker Preamble*). \n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docker Preamble:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To open this container you will need the latest Docker Image:  \n",
    "**> Please run the following from your computer's Terminal**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker pull ghcr.io/seisscoped/adjtomo:ubuntu20.04\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To save the results we obtain from inside our container, we will need to mount our local filesystem.  \n",
    "**> Please `cd` (change directory) to am empty working directory before running the following command:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 8888:8888 --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/home/scoped/work --shm-size=1gb ghcr.io/seisscoped/adjtomo:ubuntu20.04 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">__Docker commands explanation__: `pull` downloads the Docker Image from GitHub. `run` launches the container. `--mount`  binds our local filesystem (in the current working directory, pwd) with the container's internal filesytem (at location /home/scoped/work). `--shm-size` tells Docker to give us 1 Gigabyte of shared memory, which is required for MPI processes.\n",
    "\n",
    ">__M1 Macs__: Docker is not well optimized for Macs running M1 chips, as compared to those running Intel chips. This results in Docker running $\\sim$2$-$4x slower on M1 Macs. If you have an M1 we suggest you find an alternative for the workshop (Intel Mac, Windows, Linux) but if that is not possible, you can optimize your container slightly by adding the flag `--platform linux/amd64` to the 'docker run' command above (e.g., `docker run -p 8888:8888 --platform linux/amd64 ...`). With that said, please be prepared for overall slower run times, we will try to accomodate this as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    ">__SIGBUS Error__: If you are receiving the error message *Program received signal SIGBUS: Access to an undefined portion of a memory object.*, please `File -> Shut Down` the current container and reopen with a larger value for the `--shm-size` flag above. e.g., `--shm-size=2gb`. \n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Quick Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run cells** one-by-one by hitting the $\\blacktriangleright$ button at the top, or by hitting `Shift + Enter`\n",
    "- **Run all cells** by hitting the $\\blacktriangleright\\blacktriangleright$ button at the top, or by running `Run -> Run All Cells`\n",
    "- **Currently running cells** that are still processing will have a `[*]` symbol next to them\n",
    "- **Finished cells** will have a `[1]` symbol next to them. The number inside the brackets represents what order this cell has been run in.\n",
    "- Commands that start with `!` are Bash commands (i.e., commands you would run from the terminal)\n",
    "- Commands that start with `%` are Jupyter Magic commands.\n",
    "- To time a task, put a `%time` before the command (e.g., `%time ! ls`)\n",
