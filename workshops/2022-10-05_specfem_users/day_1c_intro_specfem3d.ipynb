    "\n",
    "SPECFEM3D follows very similar practices as SPECFEM2D, so what we have learned thus far will help us understand how to run simulations in SPECFEM3D.\n",
    "In this notebook we will be using SPECFEM3D_Cartesian, which has been installed and compiled in our container. In this short intro the SPEFEM3D, we will point out key differences between the 2D and 3D codes, and run a small example problem with a 3D homogeneous halfspace model.\n",

    ">__NOTE:__ These instructions should be run from inside the Docker container, using Jupyter Lab. The Docker container should have the adjTomo toolkit installed (SeisFlows, Pyatoa, PySEP), as well as SPECFEM2D and SPECEFM3D compiled with MPI. \n",

    "\n",
    "It is often desireable to run SPECFEM outside of the cloned repository, in order to keep files and outputs manageable. The trick here is that SPECFEM only requires 3 compenents for a sucessful simulation, the `bin/`, `DATA/`, and `OUTPUT_FILES/` directories. In this section we will set up a SPECFEM3D working directory that we can play around with.\n",
