    "- **Currently running cells** that are still processing will have a `[*]` symbol next to them\n",
    "- **Finished cells** will have a `[1]` symbol next to them. The number inside the brackets represents what order this cell has been run in.\n",
    "- Commands that start with `!` are Bash commands (i.e., commands you would run from the terminal)\n",
    "- Commands that start with `%` are Jupyter Magic commands.\n",
